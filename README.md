## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from over 30 core research papers published between 2020 and 2025, mapping the strategic shift from static, signature-based security to dynamic, AI-driven anomaly detection for real-time Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). The analysis reveals a landscape of rapid innovation, marked by the dominance of adaptive learning models, the rise of privacy-preserving architectures, and a growing focus on operational viability. However, significant gaps between academic research and production-ready solutions persist, particularly in dataset realism, model generalization, and adversarial robustness.

Key strategic insights include:
* **Drift-Adaptive Models Outperform Static Systems:** The most significant trend is the move to online and continual learning models that adapt to 'concept drift' in real-time. Research by Camarda et al. (2025) demonstrates that an incremental Random Forest with active learning can achieve a **99.14% F1-score** while requiring only **0.5%** of data to be labeled by a human expert. This proves that adaptive models can drastically reduce operational costs and maintain high accuracy in live, evolving network environments. The strategic implication is clear: prioritize drift-aware pipelines to keep detection effective and minimize reliance on manual retraining.
* **The Cross-Dataset Generalization Cliff is Real:** A critical risk identified is that models achieving near-perfect accuracy on a single benchmark dataset often fail catastrophically when tested on unseen data. Studies show models with **>99%** accuracy on CICIDS2017 can drop to near-random-chance performance on UNSW-NB15 due to data heterogeneity. This 'overfitting' to a specific dataset's statistical quirks means many published results are not transferable to production. To de-risk deployment, a mandatory cross-dataset validation protocol is essential before any proof-of-concept is approved. [evaluation_protocols_and_metrics[0]][7] [evaluation_protocols_and_metrics[1]][8]
* **Lightweight AI for the Edge is Production-Ready:** The proliferation of IoT demands security at the network edge. Research into TinyML has yielded highly efficient models capable of real-time inference on resource-constrained hardware. Hasan & Tasnim (2025) successfully deployed an IDS on a Jetson Nano using a model as small as **2.73 kB** with millisecond latency, while still achieving up to **100%** accuracy on the ToN_IoT dataset. The actionable insight is to embed these lightweight detectors at IoT gateways for immediate, low-latency threat detection, reserving powerful cloud resources for complex, non-real-time analytics.
* **Explainable AI (XAI) is a Force Multiplier for SOC Teams:** While complex 'black-box' models offer high accuracy, their opacity is a major barrier to trust and adoption. XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME are emerging as a critical bridge. Although generating explanations can introduce latency—one study found KernelSHAP added **8.3 seconds** per prediction—the operational benefit is a significant reduction in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR). By providing clear, actionable reasons for alerts, XAI empowers analysts to validate threats faster and build trust in the system. The strategy is to use fast methods like TreeSHAP for real-time triage and reserve slower, more detailed explanations for post-incident forensic analysis. [explainable_ai_xai_for_ids.performance_tradeoffs[2]][3]
* **Federated Learning Offers Privacy, But with Security Caveats:** To comply with data sovereignty regulations like GDPR, Federated Learning (FL) has become a key trend, enabling collaborative model training without centralizing sensitive data. Peng et al. (2025) demonstrated an FL framework that matched centralized model accuracy (**83.81%**) while preserving privacy. However, FL introduces new vulnerabilities, particularly to data poisoning and model inversion attacks. The strategic imperative is to harden FL deployments with defenses like secure aggregation, differential privacy, and anomaly scoring on client model updates before they are integrated into the global model.
* **Hardware Acceleration is Non-Negotiable for High-Speed Networks:** Software-only IDS solutions cannot keep pace with 100Gbps+ network speeds. The most effective systems offload intensive processing to hardware. In-kernel processing with eBPF/XDP has been shown to process over **224,000 packets per second** on a single core, a dramatic improvement over user-space alternatives. For line-rate performance, the trend is to use programmable hardware like FPGAs and SmartNICs/DPUs for tasks like deep packet inspection and ML inference. [key_technological_trends[3]][9]

## 1. Introduction: The Shift to Intelligent, Adaptive Network Defense

The digital landscape is characterized by an ever-increasing volume of data and a corresponding surge in the sophistication of cyber threats. [introduction.overview[0]][1] Traditional security mechanisms, such as signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), are proving inadequate as they rely on databases of known attack patterns, leaving them vulnerable to novel, zero-day exploits and polymorphic malware. [introduction.overview[0]][1] This critical security gap has propelled a paradigm shift towards more intelligent, adaptive, and proactive defense strategies. [introduction.overview[0]][1] Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as cornerstone technologies in this evolution, particularly in the domain of anomaly-based intrusion detection. [introduction.overview[0]][1] Anomaly-based detection systems learn a model of 'normal' network behavior and flag significant deviations as potential threats, enabling the detection of previously unseen attacks. [introduction.overview[0]][1] This approach is central to addressing the dynamic nature of modern cyber threats. [introduction.overview[0]][1]

### 1.1. Why AI-Based Anomaly Detection is Crucial for Modern Security

The research into AI/ML-based anomaly detection is crucial given the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the need for robust, scalable, and real-time security solutions. [introduction.importance[1]][1] As attackers develop more advanced and unpredictable methods, traditional signature-based defenses become obsolete. [introduction.importance[1]][1] Anomaly detection offers a proactive stance, capable of identifying zero-day attacks by focusing on behavioral deviations rather than known signatures. [introduction.importance[1]][1] This capability is essential for maintaining high efficacy in low-latency, high-throughput environments like 5G networks and the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT). [introduction.importance[1]][1] The proliferation of resource-constrained IoT and edge devices further underscores the importance of developing lightweight, efficient, and intelligent security models that can operate at the network's edge, providing immediate detection and response where it is most needed.

## 2. Taxonomy of Modern AI-Based Intrusion Detection Systems

The reviewed literature on AI/ML for real-time anomaly detection from 2020-2025 can be classified along several overlapping dimensions, providing a structured understanding of the field. [taxonomy_and_classification[3]][2] The primary axes of this taxonomy are the learning paradigm, the architectural deployment strategy, and the specific machine learning or deep learning techniques employed. [taxonomy_and_classification[3]][2] Many modern systems utilize a hybrid approach, combining elements from multiple categories. [taxonomy_and_classification[0]][13]

1. **By Learning Paradigm:** This dimension categorizes systems based on how they learn from and adapt to data.

## 3. Comparative Review of Prominent AI/ML Approaches

This section provides a comparative review of the key research papers published between 2020 and 2025 on AI/ML-based anomaly detection for real-time IDS/IPS, organized by the established taxonomy.

### 3.1. Hybrid and Ensemble Models: Maximizing Accuracy Through Diversity

This approach combines multiple diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to create a more robust and accurate intrusion detection system. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.description[3]][22] Architectures often involve stacking or voting ensembles, integrating models like Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Autoencoders. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.description[0]][23] [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.description[1]][24] [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.description[2]][25] The core idea is to leverage the unique strengths of each model; for example, using CNNs for spatial feature extraction from packet data, LSTMs for analyzing temporal sequences in traffic flows, and tree-based models for efficient classification. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.description[2]][25]

Hybrid and ensemble models consistently report exceptionally high performance, with accuracy often exceeding **99%** and, in some studies like Almuhanna & Dardouri (2025), reaching **100%** on specific datasets. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][26] They are particularly effective for complex multi-class classification problems. Use cases are broad, spanning enterprise networks, cloud environments, and specialized domains like the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), where they are used to process continuous data streams and detect a wide range of threats, including advanced persistent threats (APTs) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches[4]][27]

The primary strength is enhanced detection accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, as the ensemble can compensate for the weaknesses of individual models. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.strengths[5]][28] They are adept at capturing both spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic simultaneously. By combining different model types, they can create a comprehensive framework capable of identifying a wider variety of attacks. However, the main weaknesses are high computational complexity and significant resource consumption (CPU, memory), which can make them challenging to deploy in real-time or on resource-constrained devices. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.0.weaknesses[0]][26] These models often function as 'black boxes,' lacking interpretability, which is a major barrier to trust and operational deployment. Reproducibility is also a significant challenge, as recreating the exact complex architecture and training process can be difficult.

### 3.2. Deep Sequence Models (LSTM, GRU, TCN, Transformers): Uncovering Temporal Patterns

These models treat network traffic (packets or flows) as time-series data, enabling them to analyze temporal dependencies and sequential patterns that are often indicative of malicious activity. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.1.description[0]][13] LSTMs and GRUs are types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that excel at learning from sequences. More recent approaches include Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and Transformers, which use causal convolutions and self-attention mechanisms, respectively, to capture long-range dependencies, often with greater computational efficiency and parallelization than traditional RNNs.

Deep sequence models are highly effective for detecting attacks that unfold over time, such as DDoS campaigns, network scanning, and botnet command-and-control communication. They have demonstrated high accuracy (**96-99%**) on various modern datasets (e.g., CIC-IDS 2018, Edge-IIoTset). [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.1.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][13] Transformers, in particular, have shown strong robustness in detecting traffic from unseen device types without retraining. Use cases include anomaly detection in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), IoT environments, and general enterprise network monitoring.

Their core strength is the ability to model the temporal context of network events, which is missed by models that treat traffic as independent data points. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.1.strengths[0]][13] Transformers and TCNs offer the added advantage of parallel processing, overcoming the sequential processing bottleneck of RNNs and leading to faster training and inference. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is particularly powerful for identifying the most critical features across an entire data sequence. However, traditional recurrent models like LSTMs and GRUs can be computationally slow and difficult to train on very long sequences. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.1.weaknesses[0]][13] While effective, these models can be complex and require significant data and computational resources. Without being integrated into an online learning framework, they are susceptible to 'concept drift,' where their performance degrades as network patterns and attack methods evolve over time. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.1.weaknesses[0]][13]

### 3.3. Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning: The Frontline Against Zero-Day Attacks

This category of approaches is designed to detect anomalies by learning a model of 'normal' behavior from unlabeled or partially labeled data. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.2.description[0]][29] The key principle is to identify data points that deviate significantly from this learned norm. Prominent techniques include Autoencoders (which flag data with high reconstruction error as anomalous), One-Class SVMs (which create a boundary around normal data), Isolation Forests (which isolate anomalies based on the number of splits required), and more advanced methods like self-supervised and contrastive learning. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.2.description[0]][29]

The primary and most critical use case for unsupervised learning is the detection of novel, zero-day attacks for which no predefined signatures exist. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.2.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][29] These methods are essential for building proactive security systems. They are widely applied across various domains, including enterprise networks, cloud infrastructure, and IoT, where obtaining labeled attack data is often impractical. Their efficacy is highly dependent on careful threshold calibration to balance detection rates with false alarms.

The main advantage is the ability to detect unknown and emerging threats without requiring manually labeled attack data. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.2.strengths[0]][29] This makes them highly valuable in the face of a constantly evolving threat landscape. They can be trained on large volumes of readily available benign network traffic. However, unsupervised models are notoriously prone to high false positive rates (FPR), as any benign but statistically rare network event can be incorrectly flagged as an anomaly. This leads to alert fatigue and can undermine trust in the system. Their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of detection threshold, and they can suffer from instability and bursts of false alarms in dynamic network environments.

### 3.4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Modeling the Network as an Interconnected System

GNN-based approaches model network infrastructure and traffic as a graph, where nodes represent entities (e.g., IP addresses, devices, services) and edges represent the communications or relationships between them. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.3.description[0]][13] GNNs then apply deep learning techniques directly on this graph structure, learning from node features, edge features, and the overall topology to identify anomalous nodes, edges, or subgraphs that signify an intrusion. Dynamic or temporal graphs are often used to capture the evolution of network behavior over time.

GNNs have demonstrated exceptionally high performance in recent research, with reported accuracy often exceeding **99%** on benchmark datasets like NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2018. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.3.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][13] They are particularly effective at detecting coordinated and multi-stage attacks that involve complex interactions between multiple network entities. Use cases include enterprise security, high-throughput cloud environments, large-scale IoT infrastructures, Industrial IoT (IIoT), and In-Vehicle Networks (IVN).

The core strength of GNNs is their ability to capture rich contextual and relational information that is missed by models analyzing flows or packets in isolation. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.3.strengths[0]][13] They are powerful in modeling the complex, interconnected nature of modern networks. By learning structural patterns, they show strong performance, even against zero-day attacks, and have been shown to reduce false positives compared to other neural network approaches. However, the primary challenges are the significant computational overhead associated with constructing, updating, and performing inference on large, dynamic graphs. GNN-based systems are also found to be more susceptible to adversarial attacks than other methods. Other known pitfalls include handling concept drift, data sparsity, the 'cold start' problem (when new nodes appear), and a major challenge with the reproducibility of published results.

### 3.5. Federated Learning (FL): Balancing Privacy and Performance

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to enhance privacy. Instead of centralizing raw data, multiple clients (e.g., IoT devices, different organizations) collaboratively train a shared IDS model. Each client trains a model on its local data, and only the model updates (e.g., gradients or weights) are sent to a central server for aggregation into a global model. This process is repeated iteratively, allowing the global model to learn from a diverse range of data without exposing the sensitive source data.

FL has proven to be highly effective, achieving performance comparable to traditional centralized models while providing strong privacy guarantees. It is particularly crucial for security applications in sensitive environments such as healthcare (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), smart cities, and any scenario involving cross-organizational data collaboration. It enables the creation of more robust and generalized models by leveraging diverse datasets that could not otherwise be combined due to privacy regulations or business competition.

The foremost strength is privacy preservation, as raw, sensitive data never leaves the local device or organization. This significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and helps comply with regulations like GDPR. It also reduces communication overhead compared to streaming all raw data to a central server. The resulting models can be more robust due to training on a wider variety of data. However, FL performance can degrade significantly when dealing with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, which is common in real-world networks where clients have different device types and traffic patterns. FL systems are also vulnerable to specific attacks, including data poisoning (malicious clients sending bad updates) and model inversion/gradient leakage (inferring private data from model updates). The iterative communication process can also introduce latency.

### 3.6. Online and Continual Learning: Adapting to a Dynamic World

This approach focuses on creating IDS models that can adapt in real-time to 'concept drift'—the natural evolution of network traffic patterns and attack methods over time. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.description[0]][15] Unlike static models that require periodic full retraining, online learning models are updated incrementally as new data arrives. This often involves a drift detection mechanism (e.g., DDM, ADWIN) that monitors model performance and triggers an update when a significant change in the data distribution is detected. Continual learning is a subfield that specifically aims to learn new information without forgetting previously learned knowledge (mitigating 'catastrophic forgetting'). [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.description[0]][15]

Online learning is essential for maintaining high detection accuracy and low false positive rates over the long term in dynamic production environments. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][15] Studies show these models achieve high accuracy (**>98-99%**) and can outperform static models by adapting to new threats. This approach is critical for any real-time monitoring system, especially in rapidly changing environments like IoT and cloud networks, where static models quickly become obsolete. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.efficacy_and_use_cases[0]][15]

The key strength is adaptability. Online models can respond to zero-day attacks and evolving network behavior in near real-time, closing the window of vulnerability that exists between periodic retraining cycles of static models. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.strengths[0]][15] They are also more resource-efficient over the long run, as incremental updates are less computationally expensive than full retraining. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.strengths[0]][15] However, a central challenge is the stability-plasticity dilemma: the model must be 'plastic' enough to learn new patterns but 'stable' enough not to forget old ones (catastrophic forgetting). [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.weaknesses[0]][30] The adaptation process itself can introduce temporary latency or instability. Furthermore, for supervised online learning, obtaining a continuous stream of accurately labeled data in real-time is a major operational challenge. [prominent_ai_ml_approaches.5.weaknesses[0]][30]

## 4. Challenges & Research Gaps

A paramount and frequently cited challenge in the development of AI/ML-based IDS/IPS is the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available, and realistic network datasets. [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31] Many research papers continue to rely on older, often-criticized datasets like KDD'99 and NSL-KDD, which do not reflect the complexity, volume, or attack vectors of modern network traffic. [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31] While newer datasets from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (e.g., CICIDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICIoT2023) represent a significant improvement, they are not without flaws. [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31] For instance, analyses have revealed issues like massive data duplication, feature miscalculation, and labeling errors within the widely used CICIDS2017 dataset. [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31] The core problem is the significant gap between these academic benchmarks and real-world, large-scale production network traffic. [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31] This gap includes a lack of diversity in benign traffic, insufficient representation of modern multi-stage and encrypted attacks, and a failure to capture the natural evolution of network behavior over time (concept drift). [challenges_and_research_gaps.description[0]][31]

The over-reliance on synthetic, outdated, or flawed datasets has severe implications for the field, representing a major open problem. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31] It directly leads to the issue of poor model generalization, where models that achieve near-perfect accuracy on a single training dataset often experience a catastrophic performance collapse when tested on a different dataset or in a real-world environment. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31] This 'data heterogeneity' problem means that many published results are not transferable and may be misleading. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31] This lack of real-world validation hinders the practical applicability and trustworthiness of proposed models, creating a significant gap between academic research and operational deployment. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31] It also makes it exceedingly difficult to conduct fair, reproducible comparisons between different approaches, as performance is heavily dependent on the specific characteristics of the dataset used for evaluation. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31] Ultimately, this challenge impedes progress towards building truly robust, adaptive, and effective intrusion detection systems. [challenges_and_research_gaps.implication[0]][31]

## 5. Conclusion

The review of research from 2020–2025 confirms a decisive and accelerating trend away from static, signature-based intrusion detection towards dynamic, AI/ML-driven anomaly detection. [conclusion_and_future_directions[3]][32] [conclusion_and_future_directions[4]][13] To effectively counter modern cyber threats in real-time, security systems must be adaptive, intelligent, and capable of operating in diverse environments, from powerful cloud servers to resource-constrained edge devices. [conclusion_and_future_directions[5]][33] Key findings show a strong emphasis on online, incremental, and continual learning to combat concept drift; the use of sophisticated hybrid and deep learning models to enhance detection accuracy; and the adoption of decentralized architectures like federated and edge learning to improve privacy and reduce latency. [conclusion_and_future_directions[0]][34] [conclusion_and_future_directions[9]][20]

Despite significant progress, major challenges persist and form the basis for the future research agenda. [conclusion_and_future_directions[1]][35] The most critical hurdles include: the scarcity of realistic, large-scale, and publicly available training data; the high computational cost and resource consumption of complex models, especially on edge devices; the persistent problem of high false positive rates (FPR) leading to alert fatigue; the 'black box' nature of many algorithms, which hinders analyst trust; the poor generalization of models across different network environments; and the vulnerability of AI models to adversarial attacks. [conclusion_and_future_directions[10]][18] [conclusion_and_future_directions[11]][36]

Future research must prioritize several key areas to build the next generation of resilient and autonomous cybersecurity defenses. [conclusion_and_future_directions[6]][37] First, the development of lightweight, efficient, and robust AI models (TinyML) is essential for securing the burgeoning IoT ecosystem. Second, advancing privacy-preserving techniques, particularly federated learning with secure aggregation and differential privacy, will be critical for building trust and complying with data sovereignty regulations. Finally, a greater focus on Explainable AI (XAI) is needed to transform these intelligent systems from opaque decision-makers into trusted, transparent partners for human security analysts.
